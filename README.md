# SimpleFX
A simple demonstration of JavaFX. Hopefully, this demo can be used
by High School students to develop their own JavaFX applications.

Important Notice: This application requires Gradle to build.

If you don't have gradle, either download the software (it's free)
or you can do the following:

1. Look for the file src/main/java/ph/mmhsvictoria/demos/simplefx/SimpleFX.java
   and remove the package statement.

2. Seatch for the string

   scene.getStylesheets().add("css/default.css");

   and replace it with

   scene.getStylesheets().add("default.css");

3. Copy the file src/main/resources/css/default.css
   and copy it to the same directory which contains SimpleFX.java

4. Give the proper command to compile and execute SimpleFX.java
